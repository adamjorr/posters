The numbers data represents the false negative rate of the vcf used to recalibrate.
The benchmarks are from `kbbq benchmark` which does not trim adaptor sequences.
The csv's are from GATK's AnalyzeCovarites, comparing the BQSR tables from before and after recalibration. Since during construction of those tables GATK trims adaptors and hard clips soft clipped bases.
fullgatk.benchmark is the benchmark for the quality in the given BAM.
